## Project Descriptsion

* Basic Authorization is a common method used to send a username and password in an HTTP request, joined with a ':' and encoded using base64, and finally placed after the string 'Basic ' = Authorization header. The Server then decodes the 'Basic Authorization header' retrieving the username and password from the created string.
